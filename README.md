# Ruby on Rails Basics - Sprint Challenge

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected before starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score will be a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered during this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in the preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Ruby and Ruby on Rails Basics.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any reason) and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge will require you to work with two different repositories.

The [first repository](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/rails-mini-course-sprint1-challenge-create-app--starter/blob/master/README.md) contains the instructions for creating a Rails application called "awesome_blog".

The [second repository](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/rails-mini-course-sprint1-challenge-create-gem--starter/blob/master/README.md) contains the instructions for creating a gem that can be used across applications that have `published_at` fields in their models.

Go to each of the linked repositories above and follow the instructions to complete the Sprint Challenge.
